# Miniterm
Fork of https://github.com/nathan-hoad/tinyterm that adds functionality to act
as a replacement for rxvt-unicode.

## Synopsis
Miniterm is a terminal emulator that uses vte as a backend to provide a
minimalist interface. It features:

- Shortcuts for increasing/decreasing font size and copying/pasting
- Runs against vte3 for TrueColor support
- Runs a single instance to save memory, like urxvtd/urxvtc
- Parses a config file at XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/miniterm/miniterm.conf

## Installation
### Dependencies
Miniterm requires the following dependencies:

- glib2
- gtk3
- vte3 (2.91+)

### Compilation
To install, simply run `make` and `make install` which may require root
permission.

## Usage
You can run Miniterm with the `miniterm` command.

## Configuration
Miniterm is configure with an ini-like file located in
XDG\_CONFIG\_HOME/miniterm/miniterm.conf. Currently, there are two sections.
